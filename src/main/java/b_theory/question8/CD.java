    //todo A
    // What is delivery?
    // Answer: "Delivery" as a standalone term isn't usually defined in the same context as "continuous delivery" or "continuous deployment".
    // When talking about getting a new application or changes to an application to the hands of customer, then "deploy" is usually the term that is used.
    // When answering the rest of question 8 I will use the terms "delivery" and "deployment" to both refer to what was described in the previous sentence.

    //todo B
    // What makes delivery continuous?
    // Answer: Automation of the delivery process

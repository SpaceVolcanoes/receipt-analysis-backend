    // In your words (do not use wiki definitions)
    // What is compilation?
    // Answer: Converting the code that is human written and easier for the humans
    // to understand (usually written in a higher level language like Java) into code which is easier
    // for the computer to execute (bytecode in case of Java).

    //todo p2
    // Name 2 benefits of compilation?
    // 1 - takes up less space since it doesn't need to store the higher level language tokens
    // 2 - is faster since most compilers also try to optimize the code and the computer doesn't need to do
    // additional translations while executing instructions

    //todo p3
    // Name 1 disadvantage of compilation?
    // 1 - compiling process itself may take a noticeable amount of time for a larger project
